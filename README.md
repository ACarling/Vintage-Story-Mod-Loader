# A simple bare bones vintage story mod launcher
### Features:
- Create a locked-to-version modpack
- Export pack info as a string in order to easily share
- Import friends packs from a string
- Install any public mod from the mod list directly in the mod loader
- Search mods by tags / title / id / or author


### Installation
See the releases tab for the windows version of the launcher
- download launcher zip
- extract and run the exe file
NOTE:
- I dont have the money to pay for code signing so windows defender will likely go off at you 
- You will also likely need to run as admin since the launcher edits files in the following ways:
    - creates folders under AppData/Roaming/vintageloader
    - installs vintage story versions
    - installs mods
    - writes to a metadata file when adding and removing mods from a modpack
